      <p>
    After a battle in Dragon-land, Süsü healed one of their opponents. For this, his father the three-headed dragon banish him from his court. Süsü travelled to human-land, but he couldn't find his place there either as he frightened everyone he met, everyone just run away as soon as they noticed him. Luckily for him, he met the good prince who took a vow to help everyone while travelling to the court of his neighbour king to ask for the princess's hand. With a bit of effort they managed to outsmart everyone and Süsü could stay in the court as the Chief Court Dragon. During the show, we can see how he collect delicious pears during autumn, heats up the palace during winters, chase butterflies in springs, frighten away opponent armies during the summer's campaign season. After some eventful years in the king's court, one day Süsü meets a beautiful one headed dragon girl. They instantly became soulmates and lived happily ever after.
